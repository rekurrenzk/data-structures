What I have tried in LIFO, we will not be doing it here:


    A queue is a collection where the first element added is the first one to be removed

    FIFO stands for "first-in, first-out"

    For large datasets, using list to implement a queue is not efficient.

    Instead, we should use 'collections' module for 'deque' to pull and push from both ends
